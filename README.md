# Arduino Obstacle Avoiding Robot Car

## Overview

This project involves building a simple obstacle-avoiding robot car using an Arduino board. The robot is equipped with sensors to detect obstacles in its path and navigate around them. This README provides an overview of the project, its components, and instructions on how to set up and run the robot.

## Components

- Arduino Board
- Motor Driver (e.g., L298N)
- DC Motors
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- Chassis and Wheels
- Power Supply (e.g., batteries)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Wiring Diagram

Include a simple wiring diagram or a link to a diagram image here. This diagram should illustrate how the components are connected to the Arduino board.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
4. Load the Arduino sketch (code) from the project repository into the Arduino IDE.
5. Verify and upload the sketch to the Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Power on the robot car.
2. Place obstacles in its path and observe how it navigates around them.
3. Customize the code to modify the robot's behavior or add additional features.

## Code

```cpp
// Include necessary libraries

// Define pin numbers for motor driver, ultrasonic sensors, etc.

void setup() {
  // Initialize components and pins
}

void loop() {
  // Main loop for obstacle avoidance logic
}
